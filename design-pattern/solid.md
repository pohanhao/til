# S.O.L.I.D Design principle

### Single Responsibility Principle

> "One class should have one and only one responsibility"

### Open Closed Principle

> "Software components should be open for extension, but closed for modification"

### Liskovâ€™s Substitution Principle

> "Derived types must be completely substitutable for their base types"

### Interface Segregation Principle

> "Clients should not be forced to implement unnecessary methods which they will not use"

[example](#isp example)

### Dependency Inversion Principle

> "Depend on abstractions, not on concretions"

#### ISP Example

```java
public interface Behavior {

    void fly();

    void run();

    void swim();
}
```

```java
public abstract class Animal implements Behavior {
  // some logic
}
```

```java
public class Bird extends Animal {
    @Override
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("I can fly.");
    }
    @Override
    public void run() {
        throw new IllegalAccessError("I can't run");
    }
    @Override
    public void swim() {
        throw new IllegalAccessError("I can't swim");
    }
}
```

refactor to this

```java
public abstract class Animal {
  // some logic
}
```

```java
public interface FlyBehavior {

    void fly();
}
```

```java
public class Bird extends Animal implements FlyBehavior {
    @Override
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("I can fly.");
    }
}
```
