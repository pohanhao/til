# Designing a URL Shortening service like TinyURL

## Scenario
1. Given a URL, our service should generate a shorter and unique alias of it. This is called a short link.
2. When users access a short link, our service should redirect them to the original link.
3. Users should optionally be able to pick a custom short link for their URL.
4. Links will expire after a standard default timespan. Users should be able to specify the expiration time.
